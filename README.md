# support vector mechanisim
This repository explores both Regression and Classification models using a Support Mechanism. It features a Streamlit interface that allows users to choose between models and input parameters for predictions.

## About

This project demonstrates the versatility of machine learning models by implementing:

1. Regression: Predicting housing prices based on features like area, location, number of rooms, etc.
2. Classification: Classifying flower species using the Iris dataset based on petal and sepal measurements.
   
With an interactive Streamlit app, users can seamlessly switch between regression and classification models in the sidebar and input their data for predictions.

## Features
1. Model Selection: Choose between regression (Housing Prediction) and classification (Iris Dataset) models.
2. Parameter Input: Provide feature values directly in the UI for live predictions.
3. Interactive Interface: Real-time predictions and performance visualizations for selected models.
